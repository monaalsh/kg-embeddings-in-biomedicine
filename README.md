## Background
Bio-ontologies and Linked Data have become integral part of biological
and biomedical databases to assist in standardization, representation
and dissemination of knowledge in biomedicine and life sciences for
almost the past two decades. They have traditionally been utilized for
ensuring data organization, maintaining data integrity and empowering
search capabilities in the biomedical and biological domains. This rich and versatile form of data and knowledge can be
made available as ``Knowledge graphs''; a multi-relational
heterogeneous graph. Recently, knowledge graphs embeddings methods
have emerged as an effective paradigm for data analytics, and
therefore, offering new potentials for building machine learning
models for prediction and decision support in health care and
medicine.
We presents a comparative assessment and a standard benchmark for knowledge graphs representation learning methods on the the task of link prediction for biological relations. We systematically investigate and compare between state-of-the-arts embedding methods based on carefully designed settings for training and evaluation. We test various strategies aimed at controlling the amount of information related to each relation in the knowledge graph and its effects on the final performance. The quality of the knowledge graph features are further assessed through clustering and visualization. Additionally, we employ several evaluation metrics and examine their uses and differences. Finally, we discuss the limitations and suggest some guidelines for the development and use of knowledge graphs representation learning in the bio-medical and biological domains.
